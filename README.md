# vim-wikid
**Wikid** (pronounced _wicked_) is a wiki plugin for vim.

## Credit
  * I have to give full credit for my inspiration in writing this app, to all the developers that have worked on [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki). I love it, but I have a hard time navigating the code base and want to change enough about it that I feel starting from scratch will be a better learning experience for me.
